# AdminHub Security Architecture

## Overview

AdminHub provides development tools to Guest users while maintaining strict security boundaries. This document explains the security model, design decisions, and why certain operations are blocked while others are allowed.

## The Challenge

In educational environments, we need to balance two competing requirements:
1. **Freedom to Learn**: Students should be able to experiment and install packages
2. **System Integrity**: Each student must get a clean, working environment

The key insight: **Not all package managers are created equal** when it comes to user isolation.

## Security Model

### Core Principle
All Guest user modifications must be:
- **Session-isolated**: Changes affect only the current user
- **Temporary**: Everything resets on logout
- **Non-destructive**: Cannot break tools for other users

### Why This Matters
Imagine a classroom scenario:
- Student A logs in at 9 AM, tries to install a package
- Student B logs in at 10 AM, expects working tools
- If Student A could modify system tools, Student B gets a broken environment

## Package Manager Security Analysis

### 🟢 Python/pip - User Isolation Supported

Python's pip has built-in support for user-specific installations:

```bash
pip install --user package_name
# Installs to ~/.local/lib/python3.x/site-packages/
```

**Why we allow it:**
- `--user` flag enables true isolation
- Packages install to user's home directory
- macOS automatically cleans Guest home on logout
- No risk to system Python or other users

**Our implementation:**
- Force `PIP_USER=1` environment variable
- Auto-add `--user` flag if missing
- Block system-wide flags like `--target /usr/local`

### 🔴 Homebrew - System-Wide Only

Homebrew does NOT support user-specific installations:

```bash
brew install package_name
# ALWAYS installs to /opt/homebrew/ (Apple Silicon) or /usr/local/ (Intel)
```

**Why we must block it:**
1. **No user isolation**: Homebrew has no `--user` equivalent
2. **Shared installation**: All users share the same Homebrew prefix
3. **Persistence**: Packages remain after Guest logout
4. **Dependency conflicts**: Student A installs node@16, Student B needs node@18
5. **Potential for damage**: `brew uninstall python` breaks AdminHub itself

**Real-world example:**
```bash
# Guest user runs:
brew install node
brew uninstall python
brew upgrade --force

# Result:
# - Node persists for all future users (unexpected tool)
# - Python is gone (AdminHub broken)
# - Random packages upgraded (compatibility issues)
```

### 🟡 NPM - Conditional Support

NPM supports both modes:
```bash
npm install package       # Local to project (allowed)
npm install -g package    # Global install (blocked)
```

**Our approach:**
- Allow local project installs
- Block `-g` (global) flag
- Set `NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX` to user directory

### 🟢 Git - Configuration Isolation

Git already separates user and system configuration:
```bash
git config --global   # User-specific (~/.gitconfig) ✓
git config --system   # System-wide (/etc/gitconfig) ✗
```

## Implementation Details

### Security Wrapper Architecture

```
/opt/admin-tools/
├── bin/              # Symlinks to wrappers
│   ├── brew -> ../wrappers/brew
│   ├── pip -> ../wrappers/pip
│   └── python -> ../wrappers/python
├── wrappers/         # Security wrapper scripts
│   ├── brew         # Blocks modifications
│   ├── pip          # Forces --user
│   └── python       # Sets secure environment
└── actual/bin/       # Real tool symlinks
    ├── brew -> /opt/homebrew/bin/brew
    ├── pip -> /opt/homebrew/bin/pip
    └── python -> /opt/homebrew/bin/python
```

### Brew Wrapper Logic

```bash
case "$1" in
    # Blocked: Modifications
    install|uninstall|upgrade|update|tap|untap|link|unlink)
        echo "❌ Error: System-wide modifications are not allowed"
        exit 1
        ;;
    # Allowed: Read-only operations
    list|info|search|doctor|config)
        exec "$ACTUAL_BREW" "$@"
        ;;
esac
```

### Pip Wrapper Logic

```bash
# Force user installation
export PIP_USER=1

# Auto-add --user flag
if [[ "$1" == "install" ]] && [[ "$*" != *"--user"* ]]; then
    set -- "$1" --user "${@:2}"
fi

exec "$ACTUAL_PIP" "$@"
```

## Why Not Allow brew install with Cleanup?

A common question: "Why not track what Guest installs and remove it on logout?"

### The Dependency Problem

When you install a package with Homebrew, it often installs dependencies:

```bash
# Guest installs:
brew install node

# Homebrew actually installs:
# - node (what user wanted)
# - icu4c (Unicode library)
# - openssl@3 (SSL library)  
# - ca-certificates (Root certificates)
```

If we remove all of these on logout, we might break AdminHub tools that depend on the same libraries.

### The Version Conflict Problem

```bash
# AdminHub uses:
python@3.11

# Guest installs:
brew install python@3.12

# Result: Two Python versions
# Problem: Which one should pip use?
# Bigger problem: brew upgrade python would upgrade AdminHub's Python!
```

### The Upgrade Problem

Upgrades are irreversible:

```bash
# Guest runs:
brew upgrade python

# This upgrades system Python from 3.11 to 3.12
# Cannot "downgrade" back - original version is gone
# AdminHub might break if not compatible with 3.12
```

### The Formula Modification Problem

```bash
# Guest runs:
brew tap some-random/tap
brew install some-random/modified-python --force

# This could replace AdminHub's Python with a modified version
# No way to detect this happened
```

### Why Current Approach is Better

By blocking brew modifications entirely:
1. **Zero maintenance** - No cleanup needed
2. **Guaranteed stability** - Tools always work
3. **Fast logouts** - No cleanup process
4. **No conflicts** - One version of everything
5. **Predictable** - Every student gets identical environment

## Security Benefits

Our approach provides:

1. **Predictable Environment**: Every student gets identical tools
2. **No Accumulation**: System doesn't bloat over time
3. **Damage Prevention**: Students cannot break core tools
4. **Simple Mental Model**: "You can experiment, but only in your space"
5. **Zero Maintenance**: No manual cleanup needed

## Educational Advantages

This security model actually enhances learning:

1. **Safe Experimentation**: Students can try pip packages without fear
2. **Consistent Experience**: All students get the same environment
3. **Focus on Code**: No time wasted on broken environments
4. **Real-World Practice**: Mirrors corporate environments with restrictions

## Advanced Security Features

### Multi-Layer Protection

AdminHub implements defense-in-depth with multiple security layers:

#### Layer 1: Wrapper Scripts
- **Location**: `/opt/admin-tools/wrappers/`
- **Function**: Analyze commands and block dangerous operations
- **Coverage**: pip, python, brew, git

#### Layer 2: Binary Protection
- **Function**: Replace direct system binaries with security wrappers
- **Protected paths**: `/opt/homebrew/bin/`, `/usr/local/bin/`
- **Backup location**: `/opt/admin-tools/actual-direct-backups/`

#### Layer 3: Configuration Control
- **pip.conf**: Forces `user = true` for all installations
- **Environment variables**: `PIP_USER=1`, `PYTHONUSERBASE=~/.local`
- **Git config**: Blocks `--global` and `--system` modifications

#### Layer 4: Python Code Analysis
- **Import blocking**: Prevents direct `import pip` usage
- **System call blocking**: Blocks `os.system()`, `subprocess` to restricted tools
- **Path validation**: Prevents writes to system directories

### Bypass Prevention

AdminHub actively prevents common bypass techniques:

```bash
# These attempts are automatically blocked:
pip install --isolated --target /usr/local package
python -c "import pip; pip.main(['install', 'package'])"
/opt/homebrew/bin/pip install package
brew install package
git config --global core.editor "malicious_command"
```

### Security Monitoring

- **Activity logging**: All security events logged to `/var/log/adminhub/`
- **Bypass detection**: Automatic detection of circumvention attempts
- **Audit trail**: Complete record of Guest user activities

### Validation Tools

- **Security audit**: `scripts/tests/security_audit.sh`
- **Validation suite**: `scripts/tests/validation.sh`
- **Health monitoring**: Built into `adminhub-cli.sh status`

## Summary

AdminHub's security model provides comprehensive protection through multiple complementary layers. The system ensures that:

- ✅ Students can install Python packages safely to their user directory
- ✅ Direct binary access bypasses are prevented
- ✅ System-level modifications are blocked
- ✅ Python code execution is monitored and restricted
- ✅ All security events are logged and auditable
- ✅ Each session starts fresh and clean
- ✅ System remains stable and predictable

This comprehensive security architecture ensures every student gets a working, safe environment every time.
